# [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/) plugins, packaged for Nix
This is a collection of nix packages containing plugins for the Yazi TUI file manager.

## Upstream Packages
Quite Recently NixOS added yaziPlugins upstream. For this reason some packages were removed.
The Home-Manager Integration (see below) prefers the upstream over this repositories packages, as it is assumed that nixpkgs is more stable

## Usage
In your `flake.nix`, add an input like so:
```nix
{
  inputs.nix-yazi-plugins = {
    url = "github:lordkekz/nix-yazi-plugins?ref=yazi-v0.2.5";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
  ...
}
```

You can use `nix flake show github:lordkekz/nix-yazi-plugins` or `nix search github:lordkekz/nix-yazi-plugins ^` to see the provided packages.
There's also an overlay which will give you the packages under `pkgs.yaziPlugins.<plugin-name>`.

The plugin packages provided by this flake can be used with the home-manager module for Yazi, see [`programs.yazi.plugins`](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml#opt-programs.yazi.plugins).

### Home Manager Integration
> [!NOTE]
> for some plugins only packages are available. just use
> ```programs.yazi.plugins = with pkgs.yaziPlugins; {inherit pluginname;}; ```
> Note that this will not add runtime dependencies or require the plugins in Yazi's init.lua (which is not always needed)

Easily enable plugins, a sensible default is already preconfigured.
The init.lua, your keymaps, dependencies, plugins directory, ... are automatically managed for you
example usage inside home-manager:
```nix
  imports = [
    (inputs.nix-yazi-plugins.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.homeManagerModules.default)
  ];

  programs.yazi = {
    enable = true;
  };

  programs.yazi.yaziPlugins = {
    enable = true;
    plugins = {
      starship.enable = true;
      jump-to-char = {
        enable = true;
        keys.toggle.on = [ "F" ];
      };
      relative-motions = {
        enable = true;
        show_numbers = "relative_absolute";
        show_motion = true;
      };
    };
  };
```

## Branches & Compatibility
I try to support the latest release and the latest git of Yazi.
If you run the unstable version, use the `main` branch.
If you run the release version, use the corresponding branch, for example `yazi-v0.2.5`. Note that I won't delete unsupported release branches, so that your configs will still build in the future.

## Contributing
To request a new plugin or an update to an existing one, you can open an issue.
Contributions are also welcome! Feel free to send PRs.

Since plugins are written in Lua, you'll most likely only need to fetch a git repo and copy the plugin content to a derivation's `$out`.
You can generate most of the code using a tool like [`nurl`](https://github.com/nix-community/nurl).
You can also take inspiration from the existing packages.
